
# MareWood
marewood is an open source automatic packaging deployment tool for front-end

# What is MareWood doing?
marewood will help you clone the frontend Git repository. Once you associate a repository with a packaging task, you can choose the branch and command for packaging. After a successful packaging, you can access it through an alias.

# Usage

If the registered username is Admin, it will automatically become a super administrator, and usernames cannot be repeated.

## node16
```shell
docker run -d --name marewood -p 8088:8088 -v ~/docker/marewood:/marewood/resources ghcr.io/xusenlin/marewood:1.0.0-node16

# Roles

Currently, the roles are divided into: Super Administrator, Administrator, Developer, and Project Journalist. The permissions are as follows:

- Project Journalist - can only view all content and access the packaged front-end project
- Developer - has the permissions to create repositories, categories, tasks, pull code, switch branches, run builds, delete dependencies, and trim branches
- Administrator - can delete repositories, categories, and tasks
- Super Administrator - can manage users (promote and demote roles, delete users)
Note: Higher-level roles have all the permissions of lower-level roles. Users are registered as Project Journalists by default. If the registered name is Admin, it will automatically become a Super Administrator. Registered names cannot be duplicated.

  
# Note

## docker for mac
If you want to use pnpm to install dependencies in a Docker container on Mac, you need to modify the Docker file mounting method to osxfs.

The thing is that osxfs has bad performance compared to grpc, and even worse compared to virtiofs...
